### Description<a name="description"></a>

An app that will allow the user to search for a specific video game and receive the game title, a related image, a description of the game, available platforms, the Metacritic score, and other info. The user can then add search games to a playlist in which each entry can be categorized as "Want to play", "Currently playing", or "Completed/finished". The user will be able to add more games to their list, updated current entries, and delete entries. When the user adds a game to their list, they must add a status category. The user can optionally post their rating, total hours played, and their own experience/summary of the game.
